# IT5016 Assessment 3 Readme

The purpose of this GitHub Repository is to analyse this code and how various programming practices are applied, and why these practices are important for programming.

I have added various comments to the code to give my thoughts on how the code is structured and how it adheres to good programming practices.

The K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle is essential to keep in mind when programming. It suggests that you should keep the program as simple as you can possibly make it, instead of using an overly complicated solution that would achieve the same result. This principle helps keep the code that you write easier to read and understand, making it easier to edit and test in the future.

Another important principle is D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself). It states that keep repeating code to a minimum. Having multiple blocks of the same code over and over makes the code harder to understand, and more difficult to test. If the same code is being used many times, it is better to use it as a function and call upon it when it is needed.

Two big programming principles are S.T.U.P.I.D. and S.O.L.I.D., with S.T.U.P.I.D. containing principles that you should avoid using while programming, while S.O.L.I.D. containing principles that are good to use while programming.
